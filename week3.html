                Notes and plan: Last week I tried implementing a point system for how much work needs t o be done and since the project is my own I think I can try one more time or think to myself how keeping the hours of work might be better for the sake of first understanding how long I might be taking. I really would also like to make progress on the game on top of documentation but I think the work would be easier if I stook to a website based ARG so I might be shifting the game doc to a 3 parter better explaining how the website is a piece of the game.

                <br>               
                Notes and plan: We have class today so that should give me a decent amount of time to dedicate to documentation today. I was hoping that I donâ€™t have to think of new technology for the game. In some of the reading I remember them talking about how much time it can take away from developing the actual game so, in light of this information I am planning on simplifying this first phase to just the website

                <br>
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Class and and adding Website to Document Idea done.

                <br>
                Notes and plan: Working a lot more on the technical document specifics solidifying phase 1, pase 2 and phase 3. I also want to publish it now so that I can just pop it in on Sunday or Saturday to the website:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR9bHJPSmWZjAMoCREiS4PUCP8GKE2zst1zXtaoeKipNaVBpXq2mNFKCtsWWkyejG_jEZ-gjGZYYTQI/pub  
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Technical document published and website is ready for any pushes to it.

                <h4>Thursday 9/26/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Today was the rest of this weeks lecture and I forgot there can be an ART BIBLE. This helps out so much. In a way I wasn't sure how I was going to get the gamed design document more consice to
                really stay pitch size. As I was reading through the GDD's a while ago I remebe there was one document that had the puzzle details and then the solution to the puzzle and even where the player travels to after 
                each level. 
                <br>
                I am most definitley 1. cleaning up the GDD and 2. Makeing a seperate document for the Art Bible.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Re-evaluating what I could take out of the GDD was actually a bit more stresfful then I anticipated. So the GDD is back to half way done, but I did make decent progress to the art design document.

                <h4>Friday 9/27/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Nothing was worked on documentation wise. I had to reach out about ome puzzles and if I should post the answers online? Should I just leave hints in the Game design document instead or make that an entierly
                seperate document instead.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: N.A
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Saturday 9/28/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Today is a busy day I need to add more to the art document and I want to make sure I overdocument and then cut back but I feel like I have done a good job at cutting down, but I think I may have cut down a bit to much.
                 I should have backed up earlier versions of my ART doc and GDD. I do have everything on Google Drive but I didn't think of having to workbackwards or if there was a way to tag my different means of coomunication and pin the sources to 
                 the document would be great. This is simply important as I like giving credit where credit is due.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: GDD was compressed and then More added to the GDD document, and Art Document. 
                <br><br><br><br>
                
                <h4>Sunday 9/29/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:  I need to design a recognition page but that will have to wait till next week. I just really need to focus on the Art Bible today. Finish this journal and transfer it to the website.
                I also want to leave easter eggs here as well to leave little voice memos around the website about the documentation process. I think it would be fun and fitting with the main process. I know when I was a fan of these games I loved finding 
                hidden gems everywhere. I also think it'll show where my headspace is at.  
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: I needed more time on the project. All of my goals are halfway done: The GDD, Art Doc, Website, I need to start on the Technical Doc.
