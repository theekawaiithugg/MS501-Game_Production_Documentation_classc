                <h4>Monday 9/23/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: I knew from the early morning this would be a disturbingly busy week. So my thoughts are we should try and tally up how much time will be needed for each task this week. 
                I would really like to attempt the point system. I think a 1 point task would be these journal entries, or when im documenting things, as I am really just word vommiting my thoughts on to paper.
                Even though thi task does take a while to do it is not as mentally taxing on the brain. Editing and revising would be two points, as it just is more brain power. Reading or fcousing on lectures 
                take a lot out of me to sit throguh so I think these will amas 2 points per hour as well. I am hoping this will work as a basline to better document the task managment. 
                <br>
                I am hoping to read chapters 8 and 9. 
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Chapter 8 started and 4 points accumulated. 
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Tuesday 9/24/2024</h4> 
                <br>               
                Notes and plan: Today is the lecture day and specifically I want to put more depth into the document stylizing. I really enjoyed hearing about the GDD today in class. It really just happened to fit in 
                with me deciding on the style of the document. Since I do want to emphasize the puzzles and that I want it to be more of a phychologocal thriller I realize I should put a little more emphsis in adding
                the detective and puzzle side of things, I really want to leave more room for designers to put more input but I also want to explain my puzzles in detail.
                <br>
                I really want to just settle on a desighn ddocument without the puzzles for now
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Class and Design Document Idea Mostly done.
                
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Wednesday 9/25/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Nothing was worked on in the Documentation Side of things. I reached out to my little brother as he is an aspiring side quest game design type of person and I was asking how I could make the
                Stalker character less menacing, or if it would fit the vibe check, but changes to desighn were not commited so it felt like zero hours were placed. 
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: N.A I am trying to fail early here, so I have time to brush off some of the fails.

                <h4>Thursday 9/26/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Today was the rest of this weeks lecture and I forgot there can be an ART BIBLE. This helps out so much. In a way I wasn't sure how I was going to get the gamed design document more consice to
                really stay pitch size. As I was reading through the GDD's a while ago I remebe there was one document that had the puzzle details and then the solution to the puzzle and even where the player travels to after 
                each level. 
                <br>
                I am most definitley 1. cleaning up the GDD and 2. Makeing a seperate document for the Art Bible.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Re-evaluating what I could take out of the GDD was actually a bit more stresfful then I anticipated. So the GDD is back to half way done, but I did make decent progress to the art design document.

                <h4>Friday 9/27/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Nothing was worked on documentation wise. I had to reach out about ome puzzles and if I should post the answers online? Should I just leave hints in the Game design document instead or make that an entierly
                seperate document instead.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: N.A
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Saturday 9/28/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Today is a busy day I need to add more to the art document and I want to make sure I overdocument and then cut back but I feel like I have done a good job at cutting down, but I think I may have cut down a bit to much.
                 I should have backed up earlier versions of my ART doc and GDD. I do have everything on Google Drive but I didn't think of having to workbackwards or if there was a way to tag my different means of coomunication and pin the sources to 
                 the document would be great. This is simply important as I like giving credit where credit is due.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: GDD was compressed and then More added to the GDD document, and Art Document. 
                <br><br><br><br>
                
                <h4>Sunday 9/29/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:  I need to design a recognition page but that will have to wait till next week. I just really need to focus on the Art Bible today. Finish this journal and transfer it to the website.
                I also want to leave easter eggs here as well to leave little voice memos around the website about the documentation process. I think it would be fun and fitting with the main process. I know when I was a fan of these games I loved finding 
                hidden gems everywhere. I also think it'll show where my headspace is at.  
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: I needed more time on the project. All of my goals are halfway done: The GDD, Art Doc, Website, I need to start on the Technical Doc.
