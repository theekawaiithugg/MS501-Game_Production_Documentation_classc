                Notes and plan: Last week I tried implementing a point system for how much work needs t o be done and since the project is my own I think I can try one more time or think to myself how keeping the hours of work might be better for the sake of first understanding how long I might be taking. I really would also like to make progress on the game on top of documentation but I think the work would be easier if I stook to a website based ARG so I might be shifting the game doc to a 3 parter better explaining how the website is a piece of the game.

                Notes and plan: We have class today so that should give me a decent amount of time to dedicate to documentation today. I was hoping that I don’t have to think of new technology for the game. In some of the reading I remember them talking about how much time it can take away from developing the actual game so, in light of this information I am planning on simplifying this first phase to just the website

                <br>
                Notes and plan: Working a lot more on the technical document specifics solidifying phase 1, pase 2 and phase 3. I also want to publish it now so that I can just pop it in on Sunday or Saturday to the website:

                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Technical document published and website is ready for any pushes to it.

                <h4>Thursday 10/3/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Today we have the dedicated lecture time, which is always relaxing to know its a set amount of time put away just for this project. It feels more and more like time-blocking is a good Idea and fitting in the bits of time throughout the week just helps. I wanted to reference the talos principle for some puzzles that have to do with time dependencies. This honestly helped me peace together more out of what I wanted for the puzzles.
                <br>
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Time blocking the rest of my week to make sure the documentation happens, and getting a super rough draft up for the TEchnical document.

                <h4>Friday 10/04/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: I knew I would be able to squeeze chapter 13 into my day, so it was a lot of fun to learn about QA, of course growing up in the early 2000’s I was always curious about people who got to test the video games first on release. Also I was speaking with some friends on the matter because I keep falling into the trap of wanting to design something new for the game. Then in dawned on me that I may not get the answers I am looking for until the game is tested.

                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Thinking of multiple ways the puzzles can be solved.
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Saturday 10/05/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Today I have really just been grinding my gears to get these puzzles on paper. I didn’t really think it would be this time consuming, but it is.

                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Get phase 2 part way done
                <br><br><br><br>
                
                <h4>Sunday 10/06/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:   Today was not an easy day but I need to update things as much as possible. I have plenty of half thought out ideas but I don’t feel like that is enough. I keep rethinking things and wondering if the storyline should be filled out more to address the puzzles in these documents.

                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Adding a rough draft for phase 3 on the technical document. Updating the website for Assignment purposes.
