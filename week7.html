                <h4>Monday 10/21/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:  I wanted to set up proper lines of communication for the team. This means I am putting off any documentation specific items till tomorrow. 

                <br>
                We ended up settling on discord and a dedicated drive file, just for some makeshift items, since this is all by ourselves as a passion project, we will just have an extensive google sheets spreadsheet. The bulk of our time was spent on delegating and documenting who is getting tasks and access. 

                <br>
              
                Goals for Monday:
                <br>
                Set up Discord
                <br>
                Set up drive. 
                <br>
                Set up access.
                <br> <br>
                Goals for the rest of the week:
                <br>
                Commit access and responsibilities
                <br>
                Take Notes on Video Pitches

                
                <br><br>
                Goals Completed: All goals completed and a bonus. I was deciding what I would want as an answer for each question possible on our assignment for the pitch presentation.

                <h4>Tuesday 10/22/2024</h4> 
                <br>               
                Notes and plan: I made a wright up containing all possible answers for the video pitch but I still feel a bit inadequate not having the GDD completely perfect. I still have to choose which question I want to answer that will really tie my presentation together and successfully sell it out. I don’t really like the idea I put all this time into this game and not see it get picked up,  (even though this is just a drill I want to try and give it a really good shot). I honestly think question 1 is the best reason I would be selling this is game because I dont really have a specific team or dream team in mind that would help me with question 2 and I don’t necessarily want to harp on features that may or may not possibly happen. This entire experience really put into perspective what is possible in a short time frame if I only had a few months to get this off the ground. Also as it is a game that  is meant to stand the test of time I highly doubt It’s a good Idea to place a feature in a website that I may not be able to have hosted forever.

                <h4>Wednesday 10/23/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:Still working through the early morning, editing and publishing the pitch video and sending it out to get feedback from the actual team (they said I was so dry compared to my normal presentations).
                <br>
                Feed back I received could be summed up to, add more emphasis the best I know how to get the excitement through the video and to not be afraid to use up my allotted time. Finally I feel like I have time to actually work on the GDD again; I am going to plan out this attempt a bit better this time.
                <br>
