                <h4>Monday 10/21/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:  I wanted to set up proper lines of communication for the team. This means I am putting off any documentation specific items till tomorrow. 
                <br>
                We ended up settling on discord and a dedicated drive file, just for some makeshift items, since this is all by ourselves as a passion project, we will just have an extensive google sheets spreadsheet. The bulk of our time was spent on delegating and documenting who is getting tasks and access. 
                <br>
              
                Goals for Monday:
                <br>
                Set up Discord
                <br>
                Set up drive. 
                <br>
                Set up access.
                <br> <br>
                Goals for the rest of the week:
                <br>
                Commit access and responsibilities
                <br>
                Take Notes on Video Pitches

                
                <br><br>
                Goals Completed: All goals completed and a bonus. I was deciding what I would want as an answer for each question possible on our assignment for the pitch presentation.

                <h4>Tuesday 10/22/2024</h4> 
                <br>               
                Notes and plan: We don’t have class today but I still have the tasks I would have normally started on Monday. This includes setting up the normal documentation to get ready. This week I also wanted to set up links to the websites as well as this is something I would normally wait to do at the end of the week. I also need to watch video pitches and keep track of what people suggest as feedback. I also wanted to work a bit on the art concept as I have the new reorganized draft. I also received input on the website that I want to implement, so all of that has been documented as well and i will be trying my best to implement that before the end of the week.

                <h4>Wednesday 10/23/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: I decided to dedicate today to editing my pitch presentation speech. I wanted to document my changes to my original presentation and I know I need to leave presentation feedback as well. I was hoping I could publish everything today but I am assuming that will take more time then expected. I want to do this more so now then later. I also wanted to update the documents website more.

                <br>
                Notes: I knew I would be able to squeeze chapter 13 into my day, so it was a lot of fun to learn about QA, of course growing up in the early 2000’s I was always curious about people who got to test the video games first on release. Also I was speaking with some friends on the matter because I keep falling into the trap of wanting to design something new for the game. Then in dawned on me that I may not get the answers I am looking for until the game is tested.
