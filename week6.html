                <h4>Monday 10/14/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: I thought  to myself it has been a while since I referenced back to the notes. I love a good revision to accommodate how my idea has changed so instead of editing the old docs today what I want to do is just right out my concept and how my idea has changed and reference the notes again as I feel it is best to start over and then add in things from my old docs that I still like rather then edit the old document while scratching out more then half of the old document little by little. This seems to prolong the process. 
                <br>
                Sadly these are things I want to do but I do not want to get stuck rewriting the entire GDD in one night. Especially not before the pitch video. I feel like that is just really bad time management, but I am torn because I want to still make the pitch video as true as possible to the most achievable version of the game. The story did not really change but I feel like it is not the same vision.
                <br>
                Goals for Monday:
                <br>
                Look over and understand the requirements for the pitch assignment.
                <br>
                Right a mini pitch document for the presentation. 
                <br>
                Grab google doc slides from last week and pick out a proper style for the puzzle game.
                <br> <br>
                Goals for the rest of the week:
                <br>
                After we rewrite the script for presentation and clean up the presentation we should rewrite a new GDD to reflect everything new, (as plain as possible so it is easy to edit).
                
                <br>
                Reference documents for other puzzle games
                
                
                <br><br>
                Goals Completed: Today I checked the Presentation requirements and completed monday goals.

                <h4>Tuesday 10/15/2024</h4> 
                <br>               
                Notes and plan: I made a wright up containing all possible answers for the video pitch but I still feel a bit inadequate not having the GDD completely perfect. I still have to choose which question I want to answer that will really tie my presentation together and successfully sell it out. I don’t really like the idea I put all this time into this game and not see it get picked up,  (even though this is just a drill I want to try and give it a really good shot). I honestly think question 1 is the best reason I would be selling this is game because I dont really have a specific team or dream team in mind that would help me with question 2 and I don’t necessarily want to harp on features that may or may not possibly happen. This entire experience really put into perspective what is possible in a short time frame if I only had a few months to get this off the ground. Also as it is a game that  is meant to stand the test of time I highly doubt It’s a good Idea to place a feature in a website that I may not be able to have hosted forever.
                
                <br>
                Goals for Tuesday: Make a proper draft for the pitch video; 
                <br>
                Pick a proper answer to go with for the pitch video.
                <br>
                Intertwined both a traditional pitch and questions.
                <br>
                Practice pitch, collect feedback
                <br>

                <h4>Wednesday 10/16/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:Still working through the early morning, editing and publishing the pitch video and sending it out to get feedback from the actual team (they said I was so dry compared to my normal presentations).
                <br>
                Feed back I received could be summed up to, add more emphasis the best I know how to get the excitement through the video and to not be afraid to use up my allotted time. Finally I feel like I have time to actually work on the GDD again; I am going to plan out this attempt a bit better this time.
                <br>
                Goals for Wednesday: Post video
