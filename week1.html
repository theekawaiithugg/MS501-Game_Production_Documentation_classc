                <h4>Sunday 9/15/2024</h4>
                Notes and Plan:
                <br>
                For the start of this week 9/15/2024, I began by overlooking all assignments, readings, and materials available to us and planning whenI would have time for that throughout the week as I want to manage the reading appropriately as there are times where I may not want to finish the readings in one sitting, or putting things off for later. So as of now I made chapter goals, 2 being for today, chapters 3. On Scrum and Chapter 4 on Sprints. That would leave chapters 5 through 7 for Monday, leaving me with bandwidth for chapter 7 to possibly roll over to Tuesday before class.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: All goals completed, all reading completed
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Monday 9/16/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: I forgot to turn in the Sprint Log, but it was previously completed on Sunday and I just had to copy and paste it into the assignment. I did so in a rush, now there is a reminder on my phone for the next sprint log. I have Completed chapter 5 and most of chapter 6 today, I will be aiming to complete those by the end of the day, for now and I need to start on sprint log 2 and start putting some detail into the GDD
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: All goals completed (Chapter 6 reading included)
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Tuesday 9/17/2024</h4> 
                <br>               
                Notes and plan: I took a bit of time reading chapter 5, chapters 6, and chapters 7. This was really cool info I got to see how they valued time and how everyone valued working hours very differently with the point system, as I can imagine a game takes a lot of time to build and I was becoming increasingly curious on how people managed all the different taking to gether, and what if artist had to wait on programmers or vise versa. 
                <br>
                The reading lead me to think about how I was going to implement the grungy art I wanted to implement and how I would portray this in the documents. I plan on squeezing in the lecture before night time
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: All reading completed for the week but I had to save the video for tomorrow and I didn't really get anywhere on the artistic portion of the document. I did play with the fonts a bit, but it just did not feel right.  
                
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Wednesday 9/18/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Today I came up with the idea that I should make part of the puzzles have rewards so that at the end of finishing something quiet notable the player would get a download portion of the extended game, either the downloadable would be a clue or it would be something that can be examined or a mini game and then if you collected a set, the set would be able to compile together and have an actual game scenario. I want to put this in the GDD today and watch the Class video as I ran out of time yesterday.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: I started filling in this feature in the GDD. I also watched the lecture.
                
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Thursday 9/19/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: I am busy today so the Lecture is really my only goal and to add a bit more to the GDD, I am expanding on my abstract, exec summary and thinking about theme and marketing.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: I only got through working on the GDD
                
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Friday 9/20/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: I finally have time to watch this last lecture. I am also reviewing other possible competitions. I really didn’t find too much competition on Steam but there are plenty of AR’s that are free to play but not overly developed like this. I also notice the people who would be interested would most likely be puzzle enthusiasts such as people who have played MYST or Pony Island, or maybe The Black Watchmen but besides these I'm not too sure who would be looking out for a game like this. 
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: I watched the last lecture and I reviewed possible competition
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Saturday 9/21/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Brainstorming a few ideas to advertise the game since the first half of the game would be accessible for free on a website and then the rest of the game or more like pieces of the game could be offered through a game client and the player would be able to punch in numbers. I also really wanted to start a moode board for the project as I see my ideas slowly changing over time.
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: More added to the GDD document 
                <br><br><br><br>
                
                <h4>Sunday 9/22/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:  I wanted to finalize both the Sprint Log for this weeks module and this assignment, making sure things are completed. I also wanted to start on the reading for next week and start picking up the pace on the design document.  
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Finalized both documents, added more to the GDD and finished chapter 8
