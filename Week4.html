                <h4>Monday 10/07/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: This is when I had some time to set things up for the week. I wanted to start by simply setting up the Sprint logs and Journal and put expectational goals below as I find myself dragging behind as the days progress and as the time moves on I forget where I have left off on my tasks. This week in an attempt to stay ontop of things hourly, I will start with the list here. 
                
                <br>
                Goals for the week:
                <br>
                Adjust the GDD and add more of a through stroyline for people to follow as I feel like the story is more complex than what i would like it to be followed in the way that I summed everything up.
                <br>
                The next couple of steps will be to make sure that the technical document is up to par as there are technically 3 game changes to how the game will be played. 
                <br>
                Finally I want to update what the atmosphere will look like as it is not the same depending on what the player decides to do first.
                <br>
                Lastly I want to update the Art document. Also I want to set up some slides and start practicing for the final presentation.
                <br>
                (Bonus) If I have more time after all of this I will add more puzzles and solutions.
                
                
                
                <br><br>
                   Goals Completed: PARTIAL o f goal 1. Today was just updating the GDD but it is not completely updated.
                
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Tuesday 10/08/2024</h4> 
                <br>               
                Notes and plan: Today is class day and I plan on finishing chapter 16 today. I also want to update the art document alongside the GDD. I feel like I might forget everything I want to add to both of these. I was also curious if it is a good idea to log bugs found. I was very relieved to see that we can add player stories to the GDD documentation from class. I really am torn between leaving more detail about the story in vs not leaving more for the designers to decide. I feel like I should be able to add more as I am doing the first part by myself, meaning I am making the first portion of the game by myself.
                
                <br>
                Goals: Adding EZ(my brothers input to both ART and GDD documents.) Timing of game design added to GDD
                
                <br><br>
                  Goals Completed: I did not touch the GDD and focused on the Art document and adding to the player stories. We dd not come to agreement about the timing.

                <h4>Wednesday 10/09/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Today I was taking active notes from the class and screen shots to directly pull from the slides as a lot of the times I forget to implement things right away and I end up having to go back to the slides or video much later in the week, or I keep digging up the information as the documents get bigger and bigger. I want to expand the Art Document with specific details regarding the size, style, and resolution of art assets needed. Include references to mood boards or sample images where necessary.
                <br>
                Goals: I want to expand the art document and mood board for phase 2 and 3. Write technical documentation outlining the three main changes to the game's mechanics. Include implementation notes and the expected impact on gameplay.
                
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: We did all of this really.

                <h4>Thursday 10/10/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: I made a really rough draft of the powerpoint and started writing my script, I also looked into the task board items like jira as I have used it in work before but I since it really is just myself for now I am using removable sticky notes on my good notes app.
                
                  <br>
                Goals: Make rough draft of Power point, and script
                
                <br><br>
                Goals Completed: Both tasked completed

                <h4>Friday 10/11/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan:Really realizing that developing the website is a fun demo, that is free and playable for everyone even on a mobile phone, this is great as a project for now but implementing the point and click features users are asking for are a bit more challenging to implement without hosting the game. I feel like it is simply a rabbit hole of game play. I originally wanted to make pieces of the game so that they were downloadable to play if you found the hidden puzzle files. Now I realize the website can and should be used as a prologue to the game. Not so much that it should be used as a main mechanism of the game 
                 <br>
                Goals: Add detailed user stories based on feedback and research into the GDD
                
                <br><br>
                Goals accomplished today: Thinking of multiple ways the puzzles can be solved.
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h4>Saturday 10/12/2024</h4>
                <br>
                 Notes: This was a busy day and most notable I wanted to Start a glossary of terms for your game, explaining any unique mechanics, terminology, and design choices that could be referenced by future developers or team members. I wanted to document contributors and player stories properly and after documenting it here in the docs I want to add it to a website.
                <br>
                Goals for the week: Update docs and website
                <br><br>
                Goals Completed: Docs updated, slides backed up, website updated.
                
                <br><br><br><br>
                
                <h4>Sunday 10/13/2024</h4>
                <br>
                Notes and plan: Set up the documentation outline for next week, which could include tasks like refining existing documents, logging additional user stories, and documenting any game feedback received from initial game code.
                <br>
                Goals: Setting up the skeleton for sprint log 6 and journal 6, input on code
                <br><br>
                Goals Completed: Setting up skeletons complete, no input on code received
